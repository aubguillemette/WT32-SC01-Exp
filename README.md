# WT32-SC01-Exp
Fork of [seaniefs/WT32-SC01-Exp](https://github.com/seaniefs/WT32-SC01-Exp).
The goal is to make a very basic template from which I can start new projets.

You'll need to install the TFT_eSPI library and configure it like described in [sowbug's fork](https://github.com/sowbug/WT32-SC01-Demo).

More info to come later. It's 1:30 AM and I should go to sleep.
